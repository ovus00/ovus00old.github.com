## Summary

I am a Lecturer in the Department of Computing at Sheffield Hallam University. My primary research interest is Big Data Analytics and Crowdsourcing. I conduct inter-disciplinary research on highly engaging, interactive and visual mechanisms in conjunction with complex querying techniques for seamless navigation, exploration and understanding of complex datasets.

### Research 

My research involves studying and developing data and visual analytic techniques to analyse massive volumes of dynamic data in near real time. I have applied my research in a wide range of application domains such as Aerospace Engineering, Sports Informatics, Crisis/Emergency Management, Smart Cities and Mobility Planning. 

Following completion of my Masters in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, I pursued my PhD, titled ‘Visualising Large Semantic Datasets: A generic, scalable and aesthetic approach’, under the supervision of Professor Fabio Ciravegna and Professor Daniela Petrelli. My PhD thesis focused on applying interactive visualisations and User-Centered Design techniques to support exploration of large datasets using Semantic Web technologies within an Organisational Knowledge Management context. 

As a part of my research, I collaborate with large multi-disciplinary teams of academics, industry partners, city councils and planners. I was also a core member of the research and development team behind the world’s first football transfer news prediction system, FootballWhispers. I have worked in several large research and industrial projects funded by the European Union, Innovate UK and European Space Agency.
